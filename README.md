# Dwarven Mines: Hunt for the Evergreen

Deep in the ancient mines of your forefathers lies the biggest emerald a dwarf has ever seen. Venture down the randomly generated mineshaft and go get it! 

You must remember - once you set on this mission, you can only go deeper. The tunnels are dark. Torches and shiny gems on the floor help guide your way. The powerful gems on your Hammer and your Staff provide you with light. They do however fade, if you dont replenish their magic with the gems.

## Instructions: 

* Walk with A and D
* Switch between your Hammer and your Staff with Q and E
* Jump with Space
* Whatever little audio this project has, is best enjoyed with headphones.

Have fun and see how deep you can go in this endless walker, adventure, rougelike dungeon crawler mix of a game.


## Ideal World: 

The game has a great deep soundtrack with lots of vibrant ambient noises. There are cobwebs, remnants of mining equipment and skeltons all scattered around the floors and the walls. The mines are full of spiders and traps, avoiding of which requires planning your gems to not get stuck in the darkness.

I could go on, but overall I am really happy with how it turned out. This is my first _serious_ compo submission where I felt I knew sort of what I was doing and I wasn't just googling on how to move characters in Unity. The goal for this JAM was to learn about 2D lights. I know I had fun building this game. I hope you had fun as well! Thanks for sticking around if you read all this! :)
